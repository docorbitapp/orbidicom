# @orbidicom/core

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Maintenance release. Republishes the encapsulated-PDF support from 0.2.0 (whose release run did not complete publishing); no source changes. CI builds the container image amd64-only (emulated arm64 was prohibitively slow).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Render encapsulated-PDF report series. `DicomWebDataSource` gains `getPdfObjectUrl()` (WADO-RS bulk fetch with multipart unwrap, rebased onto the configured root, honoring cookie/bearer auth), and the `<Viewer>` shows a `PdfView` (lazy-loaded pdf.js) for PDF-only series instead of an empty cell. New `PdfInstance` type and optional `DataSource.listPdfs` / `getPdfObjectUrl` hooks.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`97ae566`](https://github.com/docorbitapp/orbidicom/commit/97ae5662c7dfe547ca2d1449885405da8b1dd154) Thanks [@gasci](https://github.com/gasci)! - Port the headless DICOM engine: Cornerstone init/stack, WADO-RS image IDs,
  window presets, and pluggable DicomWeb + Local data sources.
