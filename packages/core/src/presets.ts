 * their intensities are image-specific, so a fixed window is meaningless and the
 * toolbar hides the control (the W/L drag tool and Reset still apply).
 *
 * It is no longer CT-only, though: a host app can register its own protocol
 * windows for ANY modality via `registerWindowPreset({ modality, name,
 * windowWidth, windowCenter })` and they appear here (and in the toolbar) for
 * that modality. Matching is case-insensitive.
